Hello there, welcome to my personal project!

This project is aimed to be used by University of Guelph students who are having trouble planning their courses for the years ahead. This project came about when I personally had a hard time deciding what courses to take. This takes all the work of checking prerequisites and other requirements and lets you focus on planning your university career. The project still has a ways to go and optimization but my hopes is that I will finish this by the new year.

Some technologies I am using:
- Angular.js
- Express.js
- Mongodb
- Puppeteer
  - This is to scrape the university website for course information. 
  - I read there was an API I could use but its not maintained so I opted to scrape rather than use an API
  - Personally scraping a website is way cooler
- Node.js

The goal of this project for me was to get some personal experience with a full stack (MEAN). I chose MEAN because it used technology that I am familiar with (ex. Node.js) and incorporates new technology I am unfamiliar with (Ex. Angular.js).

Disclaimer: The code you are seeing is still a work in progress nothing is as it would be once it is released!!!!
